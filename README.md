pyshadertoy
===========

Shadertoy in Python, probably very outdated (ported in 2011).

Supports mouse input, see `kinderpainter.glsl` for example.

Run as `shadertoy.py shadername.glsl`.

There is a bunch of old-timey shader samples, I haven't write them, all rights belong to their authors.

Requires PyOpenGL, if GLUT doesn't start up on Windows just put glut32.dll in the project directory.
